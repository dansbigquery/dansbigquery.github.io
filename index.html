## A basic question

#### How many taxi rides have been taken since 2009?


~~~sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips];
~~~



---


## Breaking a big number down


#### How _much per year_?

~~~sql
SELECT
  YEAR(pickup_datetime) AS yr,    /* look at things by YEAR */
  COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
GROUP BY yr
ORDER BY yr;
~~~

---

### How it looks on the BigQuery interface

### Creating a visualization

(pasting the results table into a spreadsheet)


![image](/images/count-by-taxi-query-spreadsheet-chart.png)

---

class: center, middle, sec

# Think about the details

---

## What does the table actually contain?

Looking at the __schema__ of a data table can tell you what is possible:

![image](/images/taxi-tips-schema-look.png)


---

## What do people tip?


~~~sql
SELECT
  AVG(tip_amount * 100.0 / fare_amount)
FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips];
~~~

---

#### Less than 10 percent??

![image](/images/taxi-tips-first-query.png)


---

## Refine the requirements

~~~sql
SELECT
  AVG(tip_amount * 100.0 / fare_amount)
FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
WHERE
  trip_distance >= 1        /* trip is at least 1 mile */
  AND payment_type = 'CRD'  /* payment is with credit card */
  AND fare_amount >= 5.00;  /* fare is at least $5 */
~~~


---

#### 19.5 percent seems more like it

![image](/images/taxi-tips-15-pct-result.png)

---

class: center, middle, sec

# Break down the bigger numbers

---


## Should I tip more if it's late at night?


~~~sql
SELECT
  HOUR(pickup_datetime) AS hr,
  AVG(tip_amount * 100.0 / fare_amount)
FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
WHERE
    trip_distance >= 1        /* trip is at least 1 mile */
    AND payment_type = 'CRD'  /* payment is with credit card */
    AND fare_amount >= 5.00  /* fare is at least $5 */
GROUP BY hr
ORDER BY hr;
~~~

---

#### ...Probably not?


![image](/images/taxi-tips-by-hour-result.png)


---

## Be curious about distribution

Are there tip-levels that people naturally gravitate to?

~~~sql
SELECT
  ROUND(tip_amount * 100.0 / fare_amount) AS rounded_tip,
  COUNT(*) AS trips
FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
WHERE
    trip_distance >= 1        /* trip is at least 1 mile */
    AND payment_type = 'CRD'  /* payment is with credit card */
    AND fare_amount >= 5.00  /* fare is at least $5 */
    AND tip_amount > 0
GROUP BY rounded_tip
ORDER BY rounded_tip;
~~~

---

#### Visualizing the distribution (with ggplot2)


~~~R
chart <- ggplot(df, aes(x = rounded_tip, y = trips))
chart + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
    scale_x_continuous(lim = c(0, 35)) +
   scale_y_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks())
~~~

## Take inspiration/confirmation from others

[Bloomberg News: Here's How Much You Should Be Tipping Your Cab Driver](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-07-31/heres-how-much-you-should-be-tipping-your-cab-driver)

> A publicly available data set detailing every New York City taxi fare in 2013—that’s almost 100 million cab rides—reveals what a good, and bad, tip looks like:

### Tangent: how do we pay for taxis?


~~~sql
SELECT payment_type,
    COUNT(*) AS trips_count
FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
GROUP BY payment_type
ORDER BY trips_count DESC;
~~~

---

#### Look at this messy data:

![image](/images/taxi-tips-messy-types.png)


---

#### Making our own categories


~~~sql
SELECT
    UPPER(payment_type) AS paytype,
    COUNT(*) AS trips_count
FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
WHERE UPPER(payment_type) IN ('CSH', 'CRD', 'CAS', 'CRE')
GROUP BY paytype
ORDER BY trips_count DESC;
~~~

![image](images/taxi-tips-types-simple-total.png)

---

### Categories within categories

(Cash vs Credit per year)

~~~sql
SELECT
  YEAR(pickup_datetime) AS yr
  ROUND(tip_amount * 100.0 / fare_amount) AS rounded_tip,
  COUNT(*) AS trips
FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
WHERE
    trip_distance >= 1        /* trip is at least 1 mile */
    AND payment_type = 'CRD'  /* payment is with credit card */
    AND fare_amount >= 5.00  /* fare is at least $5 */
    AND tip_amount > 0
GROUP BY rounded_tip, yr
ORDER BY rounded_tip, yr;
~~~

Viz:

~~~R
chart <- ggplot(df_11, aes(x = yr, y = trips_count, fill = paytype))
chart + geom_bar(stat = 'identity', width = 1, position = 'stack') +
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("#aaddaa", "#333377"),
                    labels = c("Cash", "Credit"))
~~~



---


#### Cash vs. credit, by year


![image](images/taxi-tips-types-by-year-bar.png)

---

### Going more granular: cash vs. credit, daily

~~~sql
SELECT
    DATE(pickup_datetime) AS date,
    CASE WHEN UPPER(payment_type) IN ('CSH', 'CAS')
        THEN 'CASH'
        ELSE 'CREDIT' END
      AS paytype,
    COUNT(*) AS trips_count
FROM [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
WHERE UPPER(payment_type) IN ('CSH', 'CRD', 'CAS', 'CRE')
GROUP BY date, paytype
ORDER BY date;
~~~

Viz code:

~~~R
chart <- ggplot(df_12, aes(x = as.Date(date), y = trips_count, color = paytype))
chart + geom_point(alpha = 0.8, shape = 1, size = 0.9) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#77aa77", "#3333ff"),
                    labels = c("Cash", "Credit"))
~~~

---

#### The decline of cash vs credit, day by day

(probably too granular)

### Looking around my neighborhood



~~~sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS trip_count

WHERE pickup_latitude BETWEEN 40.7280230366 AND 40.7308523822
  AND pickup_longitude BETWEEN -73.9880597591 AND  -73.9830386639;

### Overall by race

First, have to convert "P" and "Q" to "Hispanic", and do other categorizations...

~~~sql

### Better quality stops?

As stops have decreased, the proportion of stops that lead to arrests has increased.

# Forceful stops and arrests




Via the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/nyregion/in-police-stop-data-pockets-where-force-is-used-more-often.html):

> The 46th Precinct has about 128,000 residents and includes the predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods of University Heights, Morris Heights and Fordham. Officers used force in 58 percent of stops last year, the highest rate of any of the city’s 76 precincts, according to The Times’s analysis. Yet, just 3 percent of stops that involved force resulted in an arrest — the lowest rate in the city. By contrast, officers in the 111th Precinct in the Bayside neighborhood of Queens, which is 87 percent white and Asian, were the least likely to apply force, using it in 4.7 percent of stops. Yet 40 percent of those stops ended in an arrest.

For year 2011:

| Precinct | Used Force | Force + Arrests |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
|       46 | 58.0%        | 3%            |
|      111 | 4.7%       | 40%             |

### Perspective over time

The NYT's analysis looked at 2011 -- how have precincts changed? Even without an interactive map we can see some movement:

![image](/images/nypd-scatterplot-2011-force-arrests-grid.png)

Sometimes it's helpful to condense the comparisons. Here's what the trendlines look when we divide the data into two eras:

##### 2009 to 2011

![image](/images/nypd-scatterplot-2011-force-arrests-2009-2011.png)

Remember that a visualization is not the end-all of data work: each of these outliers in 2014 may have a story:

## Adrian Schoolcraft


<img src="images/adrian-schoolcraft-portrait-nyt.jpg" "Schoolcraft" style="width: 125px; float: left; padding: 0 10px 10px 0px;">


[Officer Who Disclosed Police Misconduct Settles Suit](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/nyregion/officer-who-disclosed-police-misconduct-settles-suit.html?_r=0)


[The NYPD Tapes](http://www.villagevoice.com/news/the-nypd-tapes-part-2-6428840)

> The pressure for 250s was so great, Schoolcraft says, he witnessed officers in a patrol van at the end of the month simply filling in 250 forms just to hit the quota. He says officers would write that a person refused to give his name to avoid inventing a name. These were known in the precinct as "Ghost 250s." (A Bronx officer was once caught filing false 250s using names from gravestones in a cemetery near his precinct.)...

### [Alvin Cruz](http://www.thenation.com/article/secret-recording-stop-and-frisk-makes-it-federal-court/)

>  On June 3, 2011, three plainclothes New York City Police officers stopped a Harlem teenager named Alvin and two of the officers questioned and frisked him while the third remained in their unmarked car. Alvin secretly captured the interaction on his cell phone, and the resulting audio is one of the only known recordings of stop-and-frisk in action.

## Stop and Frisk "Receipts"

via the [NYMag](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/09/dont-forget-your-nypd-stop-and-frisk-receipt.html):

![/image](images/stop-frisk-receipt.png)

> At the recommendation of the federal monitor assigned to the NYPD, police officers have begun issuing "receipts" to people they question and/or frisk but don't arrest. The short "What Is A Stop?" form requires a cop to provide his or her name and badge number, as well as a reason for the stop in question. Explanation options include "concealing or possessing a weapon," "engaging in a drug transaction," "proximity to the scene of a crime," "matches a specific suspect description," "acting as a lookout," "casing a victim or location," and, of course, "other."
